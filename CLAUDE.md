## Project Overview

Fullstack TypeScript Template - A starter template with React frontend and AWS Lambda backend.

## Package Structure

- `packages/frontend` - React TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS (Vite-powered)
- `packages/backend` - AWS Lambda TypeScript functions

## Key Commands

```bash
yarn install          # Install dependencies
yarn build            # Build all packages
yarn test             # Run tests
yarn test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage
yarn dev              # Start frontend dev server
yarn type-check       # TypeScript type checking
yarn lint             # Run ESLint
```

## Working Guidelines

1. You must generate a commit for every piece of completed work you do - ensuring the working directory is clean afterwards (no orphaned files)

## Git Commit Rules

**CRITICAL: NEVER use `--no-verify` when committing.** Pre-commit hooks exist for security and code quality. If a commit fails due to pre-commit hooks:

1. Attempt to fix the issues in the staged files
2. If the issues cannot be resolved through code modifications, **stop and explain the situation to the user**
3. Do not bypass hooks under any circumstances - they are a security requirement
4. Do not change the git hooks that are in place
5. **You are responsible for fixing ALL linting, formatting, or other issues discovered during commit checks** - even if those issues exist in files you didn't modify or are unrelated to the work done in the current session. The goal is always a clean commit.

## External Packages

- We use Yarn to manage packages
- Always use unpinned (latest) packages unless instructed

## Code Quality

- Never leave redundant code in the codebase - this is a greenfield project so we have no need to keep old code around
- All code must pass ESLint, security scans, and coverage thresholds before commit
